When do we need Docker volumes ?
    - When we want to persist data
    - Data is gone when the container is removed or stopped
    - Virtual file system does not have physical file system.
    - Volume works when we plug physical disks into the container.
    - File system in host system is plugged into the container.

3 Volume Types 
    1) Host Volume 
    2) Anonymous Volume - for each container a folder is generated that gets mounted.
    3) Named Volume - a named volume is created and mounted.

Most used is Named Volume.
